    <h2>Book Production for Self-Publishers</h2>
      <p>
        There has never been 
        a better time to get a book into print. With the
        rise in self-publishing and print-on-demand services,
        you can publish a top-quality edition of
        your book independently, without committing to a large print-run
        or having to go through a traditional publishing house.
      </p>
      <p>
        What separates high quality self-published books from 
        the others is 
        attention to detail and knowledge of how books are produced.
        A <strong>project editor</strong> oversees the entire production 
        process, from
        editing and typesetting to proofreading and cover design, as well
        as dealing with the print-on-demand, ebook production, and 
        distribution services.
      </p>
      <p>
        (For more information about what is required to produce a good
        self-published book, read my article "<a href="articles/make-a-book.html">How to Make a Book</a>".)
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to full project editing, I offer &agrave; la carte:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>editing <a href="articles/levels-of-editing.html">at any level</a>

        <li><a href="articles/levels-of-editing.html#proofreading">proofreading</a>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about book production, or are considering
        hiring an editor (or an indexer, or a typesetter, or a cover
        designer...), please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
