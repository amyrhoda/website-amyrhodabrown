    <h2>Book Production for Self-Publishers</h2>
      <p>
        There has never been 
        a better time to get a book into print. With the
        rise in self-publishing and print-on-demand services,
        you can publish a top-quality edition of
        your book independently, without running a gauntlet of agents and
        publishing house gatekeepers.
      </p>
      <p>
        What separates high quality self-published books from 
        "vanity press" books is 
        attention to detail and knowledge of how books are produced.
        A project editor can oversee the entire production process, from
        editing and typesetting to proofreading and cover design, as well
        as the hassles of dealing with the print-on-demand services.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about what is required to produce a good
        self-published book, read my article "<a href="articles/make-a-book.html">How to Make a Book</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about book production or are considering
        hiring an editor (or an indexer, or a typesetter, or a cover
        designer...), please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to project editing, I also offer &agrave; la carte:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>editing at any level
        <li>book design and typesetting
        <li>cover design
        <li>proofreading
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm happy to take on any of these tasks whether or not
        I'm project editing your book. <a href="contact.html">Get in touch</a>,
        and we can discuss the needs of your book.
      </p>

        I will not only edit your manuscript <a
          href="articles/levels-of-editing.html">at the level</a> you
        require, I will design and lay out the book to be professional,
        appealing and readable, create an eye-catching cover, and help you get
        it into print through the publishing and distribution service of your
        choice.

      <p>
        Whether it's non-fiction, a memoir, a
        collection of poems, or a novel, I can help you
        bring your work to the market.  I offer a full range of
        pre-publication services, individually or as a package:
