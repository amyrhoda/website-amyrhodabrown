    <h2>Editing</h2>
    <p>
    I offer <a href="articles/2014/0918-levels-of-editing.html">all levels of
      editing</a> for non-fiction, academic
      and technical writing, including grant proposals, theses, articles and
      books. I specialize in science writing for professional and lay
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience editing grant proposals, technical articles,
      non-fiction books and other technical and academic writing. I enjoy
      working with writers who are non-native English speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need a skilled editor to bring clarity to your writing,
      please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I look forward to discussing
      your project.
