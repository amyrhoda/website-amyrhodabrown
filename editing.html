    <h2>Editing</h2>
    <p>
    I offer <a href="articles/levels-of-editing.html">all levels of
      editing</a> for academic, scientific, and
      and non-fiction writing, including grant proposals, theses, letters,
      articles and
      books. I edit for professional, academic, and lay audiences. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I work with all kinds of science writing, I focus on
      psychology, sociology, climate change, and computer science writing. I
      also have a particular interest in editing works about First Nations 
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience editing grant proposals, technical articles, papers, 
      letters, books, and other technical and academic writing. I enjoy
      working with writers who are non-native English speakers, and writers
      who are self-publishing.

      Here are some of the <a href="projects.html">larger projects I've worked

      If you need a skilled editor to bring clarity to your writing,
      <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> &mdash; I am happy to share advice 
      and experience, with no strings attached! I look forward to discussing
      your project.
