    <h2>What is coaching?</h2>

    <p>
      Coaching is about change: change in what you know, what you do, or how
      you feel. I will help you determine what needs to be changed, and
      support you as you make change happen.
    </p>
    <h2>How does coaching work?</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching takes place over several weeks or months; a coaching engagement
      usually spans three to six months, with meetings
      every week or every other week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first meeting of our series of sessions will be a longer
      "discovery" session, around ninety minutes to two hours.
      We'll talk about what's on your mind, what your goals are, and what you 
      would like to change. We'll get into who you are, your
      values, your satisfaction with the different areas of your life, your
      relationships, and
      any other topics to consider in order to help you move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first meeting, we'll meet regularly for an hour at a time.
      We'll talk about how you're doing and dig further into our 
      conversations about
      values, choices, challenges and victories. Each meeting will be aligned
      around your needs that day, and on the larger
      goal that we set for the whole engagement.
