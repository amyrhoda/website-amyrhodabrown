    <h4><em><a href="">Shamans Among Us</a></em> by Joseph Polimeni</h4>
	  <p>
            When Dr. Joseph Polimeni decided to publish his controversial
            theories about the evolutionary roots of schizophrenia, he
            enlisted me to help prepare and publish his book. I edited,
            designed, and typeset the book, designed the cover, and engaged a
            proofreader and
            indexer to ensure the book was as polished as possible.

    <h4><em><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open
		 Source Applications, Volume II</a></em> edited by Amy Brown and
                  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a></h4>
	  <p>
	    <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications II</em> was
            the much-anticipated follow-up to <a href="#aosa">Volume I</a>.
	    Once again, it's a compilation of over twenty chapters describing
	    the architecture of different open source applications.
	    I coordinated the writing, reviewing and editing of the book,
	    formatted it for print and designed the cover
	    and layout.

        <h4><em><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open
		  Source Applications, Volume I</a></em> edited by Amy Brown and
                  <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a></h4>
	  <p>
	    <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>, or AOSA,
	    is a compilation of over twenty chapters, each describing the 
	    architecture of an open source application. Each chapter
	    was written by a different author and so the book contains
	    a variety of prose styles, not to mention the numerous
	    different image formats used for diagrams. My job was to take
	    all those diverse chapters and make them into a cohesive
	    and elegant whole.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The book has been greeted with enthusiasm by the open
	    source community; volunteers are creating ebook versions,
	    and translating the book into Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, 
	    Spanish and other languages.

	  <h4><em><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/an-uncertain-thing-volume-i/13383902">An Uncertain Thing: A History of Childhood in the Western
				  World</a></em> by Robert McCole Wilson</h4>
          <p>
	    <em>An Uncertain Thing</em> was the result of a decade-long labour
	    of love by Robert McCole Wilson. A teacher, he spent years of his
	    retirement researching and compiling references to children and
	    childhood from sources including the Bible, classical Greek texts,
	    and Dickens. When I came to the project it was an over-1000 page
	    RTF document, which I formatted into a book using Microsoft Word.
	    I created a cover and book design to give Mr. Wilson's work the
	    showcase it deserved.
