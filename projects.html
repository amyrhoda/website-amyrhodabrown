          <em>500 Lines</em> is the fourth of the crowd-sourced AOSA book
          series, following on from <em>The Performance of Open Source
            Applications</em> and the two <em>Architecture of Open Source
            Applications</em> books. Each chapter is written by a different
          author, and describes a 500-line (or shorter) application. 
          I was hired to copyedit
          the book and create a cover (and I helped out a bit with the
          publication process on Lulu). My work on <em>500 Lines</em> was
          sponsored by <a href="http://www.pagerduty.com">PagerDuty</a>:
          huge thanks to them!

          <em>Learn Scala for Java Developers</em> is an introduction to the
          Scala programming language written for developers with experience
          working in Java. The author hired me to copyedit the book, and
          I did some <a href="articles/levels-of-editing.html#stylistic">stylistic editing</a> too.

	    <em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>, or AOSA,
	    is a compilation of over twenty chapters, each describing the 
	    architecture of an open source application. Each chapter
	    was written by a different author and so the book contains
	    a variety of prose styles, not to mention the numerous
	    different image formats used for diagrams. My job was to take
	    all those diverse chapters and make them into a cohesive
	    and elegant whole.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The book has been greeted with enthusiasm by the open
	    source community; volunteers are creating ebook versions,
	    and translating the book into Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, 
	    Spanish and other languages.

	    <em>An Uncertain Thing</em> was a decade-long labour
	    of love by Robert McCole Wilson. A retired teacher, he spent years 
	    researching and compiling references to children and
	    childhood from sources including the Bible, classical Greek texts,
	    and Dickens. When I came to the project it was an over-1000-page
	    RTF document, which I formatted as a book using Microsoft Word.
	    I created a cover and book design to give Mr. Wilson's work the
	    showcase it deserved.
