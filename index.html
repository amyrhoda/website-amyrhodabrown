    <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
      I'm a freelance editor specializing in academic, science and
      non-fiction works. I work with self-published authors
      and academic writers to clarify their writing so nothing comes between
      their message and the reader.
      </p>

       <p>
         Computer science, psychiatry, sociology, computational fluid dynamics,
         web typography, art:
         these are a few of the subjects I've edited, in papers, books,
         cover letters, and grant proposals.
