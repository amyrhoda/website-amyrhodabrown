    <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
      I'm a freelance editor specializing in academic, scientific, and
      non-fiction writing. I work with self-published authors
      and academic writers to clarify their writing, so nothing comes between
      their message and the reader.
      </p>

       <p>
       I have edited papers, books, cover letters, grant proposals, and 
       other writing on topics including 
         climate change, Aboriginal law, computer science, 
         psychiatry, sociology, computational fluid dynamics,
         typography for the web, and sculpture gardens.
