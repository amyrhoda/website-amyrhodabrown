    <h2>Personal Development Coach</h2>

    <p>
    Coaching is about change; change in what you know, what you do, or how
    you feel about your life. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    As an Adler-trained coach, I offer the gifts of attentive listening (when is
    that last time someone really listened to you), insightful questions, and
    the Beginner's Mind. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Most importantly, I offer trust in you: trust that you know what you need,
    that you know what to do, and that you can achieve your goals. (Yes &mdash;
    even if you don't trust yourself.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Together we will discover what you need to change (if you don't already
    know), and figure out your next move. Then I will support you (and hold you
    accountable) while you take those steps to becoming your unique Best Self.
