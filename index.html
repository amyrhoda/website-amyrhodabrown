    <h3>Personal Development Coach</h3>

    <p>
    Coaching is about change: change in what you know, what you do, and how
    you feel about your life. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    As an Adler-trained coach, I offer attentive listening, insightful 
    questions, and the beginner's mind &mdash; the ability to approach you and
    your goals without preconceptions about your options, your potential, or
    your future. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Most importantly, I offer trust in you: trust that you know what you need,
    that you know what to do, and that you can achieve your goals. (Yes &mdash;
    even when you don't trust yourself.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Together we will discover what you need to change (if you don't already
    know), and figure out your next move. Then I will support you (and hold you
    accountable) while you take those steps to becoming your best.
    </p>

    <h2>Beginner's Mind</h2>

      "If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to
      everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in
      the expert's mind there are few."

      <p>
      I bring Beginner's Mind to every coaching session. That means I don't
      assume I know anything: anything about you, about what you want or need
      that day,
      about what is getting in your way. That openness creates space for 
      me to ask you
      questions which will help you understand your own situation, challenges,
      and potential in a new way.
