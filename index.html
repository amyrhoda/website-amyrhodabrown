    <h2>Level-Up Your Life</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching is about levelling up &mdash; levelling up your skills, your
      awareness, your happiness, your life.
    </p> 
    <p>
    As an Adler-trained coach, I will listen, ask 
    questions, and bring beginner's mind to your goals. Together we'll
    understand your assets and your possibilities to level you up to the
    future you want.
    </p>
    <p>
    Working with me, you'll get space and time to think out loud, 
    thought-provoking questions to change your perspective and shift your
    mindset, and me in your corner, believing in you and cheering you on
    through your journey.
    </p>
    <p>
    Together we will discover what you need to change and figure out 
    your best move. Then I will support you and hold you
    accountable while you grow and change in ways you only dreamed of.
    </p>

    <h2>Beginner's mind</h2>

      "If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to
      everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in
      the expert's mind there are few."
