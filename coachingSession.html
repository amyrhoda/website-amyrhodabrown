      Hi! If you're reading this, you have probably seen my invitation to have
      a coaching conversation. If you're curious about what exactly
      that means, I hope this answers some of your questions.
    </p>
    <h2>What's a coaching session like?</h2>
    <p>
      A coaching session is about you, the coachee. You arrive with an issue: a
      problem, question, dilemma, conundrum, quandary or puzzle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your tools for this work are conversation and reflection; it's a
      chance to think out loud and have space and time to sit with your
      thoughts. My tools are deep listening, quietude, questions, observations,
      humour, and a genuine belief that you have within you what you need to
      succeed.
    </p>
    <h4>Issue</h4>
    <p>
      We start by examining your issue. What's important about it? Why is it
      important now? What will you get if you figure it out? What if you don't
      figure it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the process, we might discover a deeper or more incisive way to
      understand the issue, or even discover that the issue is something else
      altogether. Already your awareness is deepening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you understand the issue better, we do a deep dive. Where does
      the issue sit in your life? We consider the context, your beliefs and
      mindset around the issue, how your experience relates to it. What is at
      stake? What will be different if this is resolved?
    </p>
    <h4>Choice</h4>
    <p>
      Next, with a clearer understanding of the situation I'll invite you to
      consider what your choices are. What do you have control over and what is
      out of your hands? What are the possibilities?
    </p>
    <h4>Action</h4>
    <p>
      Then it's time to commit to action and set your goals and intentions.
      We'll consider potential obstacles and come up with a game plan to deal
      with them. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      You will walk away from our conversation with a better understanding of
      your situation and a concrete plan for moving forward and making change in
      yourself and in your world.
    </p>

      <h2>In a Coaching Relationship</h2>

    <p>
      If that session were part of a longer coaching relationship, rather than
      a one-off, a few things would be different. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you and I would have a closer, more trusting relationship, which
      would create a context in which you could go deeper and be more
      introspective, gaining a better awareness of yourself and your situation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I would know you better, which means I could ask you more customized and
      relevant questions, and I would have a richer appreciation of your
      situation and your growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, a long-term coaching relationship means I can provide
      accountability over time, which leads to more growth and change for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Curious?</h2>
    <p>

      like to learn more about coaching or talk about engaging me for a longer
      coaching relationship, please <a href="contact.html">let me know</a>.
