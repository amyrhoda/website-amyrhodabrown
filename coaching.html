    <h2>What is coaching?</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching is about change: change in what you know, what you do, or how
      you feel. A coach will help you determine what needs to be changed, and
      will support you as you make changes to live a richer and more
      meaningful life.
    </p>
    <h2>How does coaching work?</h2>
    <p>
      The coaching process takes place over several weeks or months; a series
      of coaching sessions usually spans three to six months, with meetings
      every other week.  Once you have decided to enlist me as your coach,
      we'll agree on how long
      to work together. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first meeting of our series of sessions will be a longer,
      getting-to-know-you meeting lasting ninety minutes to two hours.
      We'll talk about what is on your mind, what your goals are, and what you 
      would like to change or work on. We'll get into who you are, what your
      values are, whether you feel like you have balance in your life, and
      any other topics to consider in order to help you move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first meeting, we'll meet every two weeks for about an hour.
      We'll see how you're doing and dig further into our conversations about
      values, choices, challenges and victories. Each meeting will be aligned
      around your needs that day and on the larger question of how to achieve
      the goal that we set for the series of sessions. 
    </p>
    <p>
