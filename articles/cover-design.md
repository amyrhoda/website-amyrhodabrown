    <h2>Cover Design</h2>
      <p>
      <strong>Cover design</strong> is another opportunity for you to 
        establish 
        your book as a professional quality product &mdash; or turn people off
        it altogether. There are many ways for cover design to succeed or fail,
        but as with typography, it often takes an expert to tell exactly what
        is wrong with a cover; to the untrained eye, it just 
        looks off. (See <a
          href="http://www.thebookdesigner.com/category/cover-design/"
          target="_blank" title="Joel Friedlander's Cover Design Awards; opens
          in a new tab">Joel Friedlander's cover design awards</a> for lots of
        excellent discussion about what makes a cover good.)

        <p>
        I have designed 
        <a href="/projects.html">a few simple covers</a>; non-fiction
        book covers don't require a lot of creativity or clever imagery,
        just clear typography, a balanced and pleasing design,
        and an eye-catching
        image or colour scheme. If I were marketing a fiction book or wanted
        a really stunning cover I would
        likely hire a graphic designer who specializes in cover design, for
        that extra creative spark &mdash; you get what you pay for!
