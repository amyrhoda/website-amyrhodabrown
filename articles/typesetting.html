    <h2>About Typesetting</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Typesetting</strong> is the process of designing your book
        (that is, deciding which font to use, what should go in the running
        headers, what chapter title
        pages look like, etc.) and using typesetting software to generate a
        PDF version of your book to send to the print-on-demand service.
        </p>
        <p>
        Typesetting is a tricky business; most people won't pick up a book
        and say, "This typesetting is fantastic, I want to buy this book!"
        or "This typesetting is clumsy and inept; clearly this book was
        produced by amateurs." It's much more subtle than that &mdash; a poorly
        typeset book will seem chintzy, tacky, unreliable, just <em>off</em>
        somehow. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Good typesetting, on the other hand, doesn't draw
        attention to itself but gives an impression of quality, reliability,
        and weight.

        But how to get that feeling of quality? You can create a flawless, 
        professional book using a piece of free software called LaTeX, but
        it's difficult and often frustrating. You can use professional
        typesetting software from a company like Adobe which will give
        you a fantastic result, but the software is extremely expensive and
        not easy to use. Or you can use Microsoft Word, which historically 
        has given disappointing, amateurish results. There are now
        commercially-available templates for Microsoft Word which claim
        to provide professional typesetting; I have not looked into them
        myself.
