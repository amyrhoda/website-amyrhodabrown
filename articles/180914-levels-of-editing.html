    <h2>Levels of Editing</h2>
    <p>
      Every document is different &mdash; different writer, different audience,
      different voice &mdash; so editors offer various levels of editing. 
      This article explains the levels of editing I offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're still not sure what level of editing you need after you
      read this, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> &mdash; I would
      be happy to review a few pages of your document and talk about what
      you're hoping for.
      </p>
    <p>
      The community of editors has not yet settled on
      consistent names or definitions for
      each level of editing, so I've included some of the most common names.
      My definitions are pretty close to those used by the 
      <a href="http://www.editors.ca/hire/definitions.html">Editors'
        Association of Canada</a>.

    <h4 class="linkable" id="developmental">1. Developmental (or Structural or 
        Substantive) Editing</h4>
      <p>
      Developmental editing is the big-picture edit; we'll work together to
      assess the structure of your entire document at the chapter and paragraph
      level. What order should ideas be presented in? How long should the
      chapters be? Is your tone consistent and appropriate? 
      </p>
      <p>
      Developmental editing has to happen quite early in the process; it 
      can be very discouraging to feel like your document is "just about done" 
      and then realize that, say, the ideas really should be presented in
      the reverse order! But developmental editing can be a great option if 
      you're "stuck" or don't understand why your work isn't coming together
      the way you feel it should.
      </p>
      <p>
      When I do a developmental edit on your book, I'll read it with an
      eye to the big picture: Does the logic make sense? Are you explaining
      your ideas in the right order? Could we present the material in a 
      better framework? Can we structure the material using a metaphor? 
      Are transitions between sections awkward?  Should we use sidebars,
      footnotes, or endnotes?  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll also consider the tone of your writing. Is it written at the
        correct
        level? Is the writing consistent, or do you switch between casual
        language and a 
        more academic style? Is it ever patronizing? Sarcastic? I'll give you
        suggestions to help smooth over changes in tone which might distract
        your reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I have finished reviewing
        your document, I'll send it back to you with comments and notes for
        suggested revisions, as well as a report on the overall structure 
        of the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developmental editing does not include stylistic editing or copyediting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about developmental editing, have a look at
        Scott Norton's excellent book, <a
        href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo5604692.html">Developmental
        Editing: A Handbook for Freelancers, Authors, and Publishers</a>.
      </p>
      <h4 class="linkable" id="stylistic">2. Stylistic (or Content or Heavy)
        Editing</h4> 
      <p>
        Stylistic editing can be thought of as paragraph-level editing.
        I'll edit your document with a focus on clarity of logic, clarity
        of language, and sensible paragraph and sentence structure. I'll
        look out for vagueness, redundancy, inconsistency, and wordiness.
        I'll check consistency in headings and captions, and look over figures
        and tables for consistency, readability and correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stylistic editing includes copyediting.
      </p>
      <h4 class="linkable" id="copyediting">3. Copyediting (or Light Editing)</h4>
      <p>
        Copyediting is the last stage of editing, and can be thought
        of as editing the "mechanics" of your work. I'll correct grammar,
        punctuation, and spelling. I'll look for misused words, and check
        for consistency in captions, headers, references, and citations.
        Copyediting adds the final polish to make your writing
        clear and readable.
      </p>
      <h4 class="linkable" id="proofreading">4. Special Mention:
        Proofreading</h4>
      <p>
        The word "proofreading" is often used interchangably with 
        "copyediting", but they are very different things. To proofread
        is to read a proof, which is to say the final pre-publication
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">galley proof</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of proofreading isn't to find major grammatical errors or
        logic mistakes &mdash; it's far too late for that. A proofreader
        most often finds mistakes in typesetting: wrong page numbers, 
        inconsistent heading design, incorrect indexing. (You can correct
        <em>minor</em> spelling and punctuation mistakes at the proofreading 
        stage, so long as it doesn't affect where the page breaks are.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I offer proofreading &mdash; in fact, it's one of my favourite
        jobs &mdash; but proofreading jobs usually come from other editors
        or publishers. That's because an editor should never proofread 
        the work she's edited or typeset; by the time I've spent hours with
        your work I'm too familiar with it and risk missing things. (I am 
        happy to help you find a proofreader for a work I've edited and/or
        typeset.)
