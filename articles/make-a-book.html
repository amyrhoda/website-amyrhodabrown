    <h2>How to Make a Book</h2>
      <p>
        Like many things (cake, shoes, boats), books are harder to put together
        than they seem. And like many things, the first 90% of the job (the 
        writing) takes 90% of the time, and the final 10% also takes 90% of 
        the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the minimum steps required (in my opinion) to create a
        good self-published non-fiction book:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> writing, optionally including:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="levels-of-editing.html#developmental">developmental editing</a></li>
          <li>incorporating feedback from beta readers</li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#stylistic">stylistic editing</a></li>
        <li> creation of front matter (table of contents, copyright page, dedication, acknowledgments, etc.), back matter, and cover copy</li>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#copyediting">copyediting</a></li>
        <li> indexing</li>
        <li> typesetting</li>
        <li> cover design</li>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#proofreading">proofreading</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Not to mention:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>dealing with the print-on-demand company or printer, who
        will have their own requirements for file types, book metadata, and so
        on</li>
        <li>ebook production for several different devices</li>
        <li>marketing and promotion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At a publishing company, ten, twenty or more people might
        work on your book through the various stages. As a self-publisher you
        probably can't afford to hire ten or twenty people, but you should
        certainly hire one or two: an editor for sure, an indexer if you want a
        good index, a proofreader to check your final proof.
      </p>

      Read on for more information about two overlooked aspects of the book
      production process, typesetting and cover design, or
        visit my <a href="levels-of-editing.html">Levels of Editing</a> page
        for more information about that. (And <a href="contact.html">contact
          me</a> if you are looking for help publishing your book.)

      <strong>Typesetting</strong> is the process of designing your book (which
      font will
        you use, what should go in the running headers, how do chapter title
        pages look, etc.) and using typesetting software to generate a
        PDF version of your book to send to the print-on-demand service.
        </p>
        <p>
        Typesetting is a tricky business; most people won't pick up a book
        and say, "This typesetting is fantastic, I want to buy this book!"
        or "This typesetting is clumsy and inept; clearly this book was
        produced by amateurs." It's much more subtle than that &mdash; a poorly
        typeset book will seem chintzy, tacky, unreliable, just <em>off</em>
        somehow. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Good typesetting, on the other hand, doesn't draw
        attention to itself but gives an impression of quality, reliability,
        and weight.
        </p>
        <p>
        But how to get that feeling of quality? You can create a flawless, 
        professional book using a piece of free software called LaTeX, but
        it's difficult and often frustrating. You can use professional
        typesetting software from a company like Adobe which will give
        you a fantastic result, but the software is extremely expensive and
        not easy to use. Or you can use Microsoft Word, which historically 
        has given disappointing, amateurish results. There are now
        commercially-available templates for Microsoft Word which claim
        to provide professional typesetting; I have not looked into them
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Cover design</strong> is another opportunity for you to either
      establish 
        your book as a professional quality product or turn people off it
        altogether. There are many ways for cover design to succeed or fail,
        but as with typography, it often takes an expert to tell exactly what
        is wrong with a cover; to the untrained eye, it just 
        looks off. <!-- FIXME: put
        in a link to Friedlander's cover design blogs, or whoever it was. -->
        </p>
        <p>
        I have designed 
        a few covers, most of them good; non-fiction
        book covers don't require a lot of creativity or clever imagery,
        just clear typography (again), a balanced and pleasing design,
        and an eye-catching
        image or colour scheme. (If I were marketing a fiction book I would
        likely hire a graphic designer who specializes in cover design, for
        that extra creative spark.)
