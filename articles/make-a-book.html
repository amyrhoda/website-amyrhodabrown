    <h2>How to Make a Book</h2>
      <p>
        Like many things &mdash; croissants, shoes, boats &mdash; books are harder to put together
        than they seem. And like many things, the first 50% of the job (the 
        writing) takes 90% of the time, and the second 50% also takes 90% of 
        the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the minimum steps required (in my opinion) to create a
        good self-published non-fiction book:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> writing, optionally including:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="levels-of-editing.html#developmental">developmental editing</a></li>
          <li>incorporating feedback from beta readers</li>
        </ul>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#stylistic">stylistic editing</a></li>
        <li> creation of front matter according to publishing conventions (table of contents, copyright page, dedication, acknowledgments, etc.), back matter, and cover copy</li>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#copyediting">copyediting</a></li>
        <li> <a href="typesetting.html">typesetting</a></li>
        <li> indexing</li>
        <li> <a href="cover-design.html">cover design</a></li>
        <li> <a href="levels-of-editing#proofreading">proofreading</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Not to mention:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>dealing with the print-on-demand company or printer, who
        will have their own requirements for file types, book metadata, and so
        on</li>
        <li>ebook production for several different devices</li>
        <li>marketing and promotion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At a publishing company, ten, twenty or more people might
        work on your book through the various stages. As a self-publisher you
        probably can't afford to hire ten or twenty people, but you should
        certainly hire one or two: an editor for sure, an indexer if you want a
        good index, a proofreader to check your final proof.
