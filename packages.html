      engineer,

      <ul>
        <li>wants to improve hard or soft skills</li>
        <li>is in a new position, company, or culture</li> 
        <li>is dealing with imposter syndrome, self doubt, or an inner
          critic</li>
        <li>is navigating the tech industry as member of a marginalized
          community</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In our work together, you'll gain a deeper understanding of yourself,
      your strengths and values, and the beliefs and mindsets you hold which
      either support you or hold you back. You'll figure out how to
      leverage your strengths and assets to thrive, not just at work but 
      in everything you do. I'll provide accountability as you commit to making
      changes in your behaviour and your beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>

      We'll start with a 1.5 hour discovery session, a deep dive into you and
      your life. For the next 11 sessions, we'll meet every other week 
      for an hour to debrief,
      talk, brainstorm, envision and implement the next step in your career
      level up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also available: <strong>Career Level Up for Tech, Mini</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Coaching
      can be a daunting expense, but I believe it's valuable to everyone, not
      just executives and senior leaders. So to make coaching accessible to
      more people, I offer a mini version of the Career Level Up.
      You'll get the same 1.5 hour discovery session, and then 5 more sessions,
      every other week, where we'll clarify your values and strengths and start
      to gain clarity on what's getting in your way.
