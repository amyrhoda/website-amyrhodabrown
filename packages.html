    <h2 id="career4tech">Career Level-Up for Tech</h2>
    <p>
      The Career Level-Up for Tech package is for you if you're a developer, 
      engineer,
      and other individual contributor who wants to improve hard or
      soft skills, or who is navigating a new position, company, or culture. 
      It's for you if you're dealing with imposter syndrome, self doubt, 
      or the inner critic, or if you're navigating the tech industry as a
      marginalized person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through coaching with me, you'll gain a deeper understanding of yourself,
      your strengths and values, and the beliefs and mindsets you hold which
      either support you or hold you back. You'll figure out how to
      leverage your strengths and assets to thrive, not just at work but 
      in everything you do. I'll provide accountability as you commit to making
      changes in your behaviour and your beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duration: 12 sessions<br /> 
      We'll start with a 1.5 hour discovery session, a deep dive into you and
      your life. Every week for the next 11 weeks we'll meet for an hour to 
      talk, brainstorm, envision and implement the next step in your career.
