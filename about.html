    <h2>About Amy</h2>

      I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6768643-amy-brown"
        target="_blank" title="My profile on Goodreads; opens in a new
        tab">love to read</a>, and I love books, not
      just because they contain lots
      of words to read, but as objects in their own right. I like the
      way they feel and look, and I like all the decisions that go into 
      making a book: how big should it be, what goes on the cover, what 
      typefaces should we use?

      I'm a member of the Editors Association of Canada, and I often attend
      their excellent seminars. I also improve my editing skills and knowledge
      by reading books, or simply consulting with other editors.

      I also love science: the process of it and the truths that it
      reveals. I like knowing new things, but I also enjoy that state of not
      knowing, when we have some hypotheses but we're not sure which one is
      right. I also like that feeling when you find out that something you 
      thought was true <em>isn't</em>; I like to be suprised and challenged.

       I live in Toronto with my husband and two daughters. When I'm not
       helping people communicate, I read (for fun), sing, walk, and
       hang out with my kids.
