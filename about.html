    <h2>About Amy</h2>

    <!-- founder story -- what makes me the ideal person -->
    I have twenty years of cross-sector experience in technology, communications, and research, as an employee and as an entrepreneur. I started my career in the software industry, working at companies ranging in size from 40 employees to tens of thousands. After several years, I reinvented myself as a self-employed publishing industry contractor and built a successful business as a copyeditor and self-publishing consultant. 
    
    Now I'm bringing the communication, empathy, growth and resilience skills I developed through my career to coaching. I am most interested in working with early-career professionals, entrepreneurs, and others looking to make a career change in order to align their daily work to their values. 
    
    We spend most of our waking hours at work, and I believe everyone deserves to feel fulfilled and respected at their job. I also believe that when our work is aligned with our strengths, not only do we feel personally fulfilled, but everyone around us wins as well because we are able to offer the best of ourselves.

    <!-- my core values: respect and connection -->

    <!-- my offerings and why I sell what I sell -- say something about offerings later in the year regarding teams and leadership, startups -->
