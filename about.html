    <h2>About Amy</h2>
    <p>
      A few years ago I had just sent my youngest child off to kindergarten,
      and I had some time on my hands. My friend Greg Wilson
      had the opposite problem &mdash; too much to do, not enough hands &mdash;
      so he asked
      me to help him project-edit, and eventually self-publish, a book
      called <em><a href="projects.html#aosa">The Architecture of Open 
          Source Applications</a></em>. I enjoyed the process so much that
      I collaborated on the <a href="projects.html#aosa2">second
        volume</a>, and decided to make editing and self-publishing my
      career.
      </p>
      <p>
      I love to read, and I love books, not just because they contain lots
      of words to read, but as objects in their own right. I like the
      way they feel and look, and I like all the decisions that go into 
      making a book: how big should it be, what goes on the cover, what 
      typefaces should we use? I like deciphering the subtext
      of those choices.
      </p>
      <p>
      I also love science: the process of it and the truths that it
      reveals. I like knowing new things, but I also enjoy that state of not
      knowing, when we have some hypotheses but we're not sure which one is
      right. I also like that feeling when you find out that something you 
      thought was true <em>isn't</em>, and the new truth makes so much more
      sense
      and you realize (or you tell yourself) that you were never really 
      comfortable with the old truth after all.
      </p>
      <p>
      I believe science is the only way we're going to fix the 
      problems of the world, and it's important that my work
      contributes to the solutions.
      </p>
       <p>
       I live in Toronto with my husband and two daughters. When I'm not
       helping people communicate, I read (for fun), sing, walk, bake, and
       hang out with my kids.
