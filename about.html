        target="_blank" title="My profile on Goodreads; opens in a new
        tab">love to read</a>, and I love books &emdash; not
      just because they contain lots
      of words to read, but as objects in their own right. I like the
      way they feel and look.

      I'm a member of the Editors Association of Canada, and I attend
      their excellent seminars as often as I can. I also improve my editing
      skills and knowledge by reading books, and consulting with other editors.

       I live in Toronto with my husband and two daughters. When I'm not
       helping people communicate, I read (for fun), sing, walk, write, and
       hang out with my kids.
