    <h2>About Amy</h2>

    <p>
    My name is Amy Rhoda Brown, and I want you to shine.
    </p>
    <p>
    I work with leaders and teams at high tech startups, and with
    creative entrepreneurs and independent artists. I help people navigate
    change and get out of their own way as they work towards greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
    "I have twenty years of cross-sector experience in technology,
    communications, and research, as an employee and as an entrepreneur."
    </p>
    <p>
    That's the LinkedIn version &mdash; doesn't it sound great? Twenty years!
    </p>
    <p>
    But the reality is, my path didn't seem so clear when I was living
    through it.  Like most of us, I just tried to make the best choices
    with the resources available to me.
    </p>
    <p>
    Looking back, I wouldn't change any of the decisions I made, but I don't
    want to sit here, right on my own website, and try to tell you that it's
    been a smooth, logical road from there to here. It has not. It's been
    rocky, it's been weird, occasionally I have ended up in places I did not
    want to be. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    I started with a degree in Math from the University of Waterloo.
    After working in software development for eight years, my life took a hard 
    turn into full-time parenting for a few years. For a while I worked with an
    organization which presented big-data computing workshops to researchers,
    and I freelanced as a copyeditor. I did that for several years,
    but realized I enjoy the company of people too much for such solitary work.
    (And to be real, my attention span isn't long enough for full-time
    copyediting.)
    </p>
    <p>
    It was a mild day in early October 2018 when I attended the workshop 
    that changed my career. For a few months I had been feeling that something
    was off in my life &mdash; I was on the wrong path, 
    something had to change. I just didn't know what.  
    </p> 
    <p>
    In the spirit of
    experimentation I signed up for a bunch of things: workshops, conferences, 
    events, meetups. A workshop called "Emotional Decoupling", run by Toronto
    coach Sonia Grossi, was one of those events.
    </p> 
    <p>
    I loved it; I contributed to the group discussion and realized I had a lot
    to say. But even more satisfying was talking to other participants in the
    one-to-one workshop portion of the evening. I loved hearing about people's
    stories and challenges.
    </p> 
    <p>
     That was the day I realized that the years of reading and work I had done
     on personal development, and my fascination with and love for people,
     could be more than just an interesting sidebar, it could be a job:
     coaching. By the end of the month I had signed up for the coaching program
     at the <a href="https://www.adler.ca/" target="_blank">Adler Graduate
     Professional School</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    So here I am today, with empathy, communication skills, and a 
    hard-earned, bone-deep understanding of what it takes to grow and thrive
    when it seems like you have too many choices and not enough all at
    the same time. I'm ready to listen, really listen, and give you the space,
    trust, encouragement, and accountability that you need in order
    to thrive.
    </p> 

    <h3>Curious?</h3>
    <p>
    <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> if you have questions, or to arrange
    a quick, no-obligation conversation to see if coaching is right for you. I
    would love to talk to you!
